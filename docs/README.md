## Documentation Rules

1. **Single Source of Truth:** `/REQUIREMENTS.md` is the only authoritative requirements doc
2. **Use Correct Terms:** Check `/docs/TAXONOMY.md` for proper terminology
3. **If it's not in code, it doesn't exist:** Don't document aspirational features as if they're real
4. **Mark clearly:** Use "TODO", "Future", "Planned" for things that don't exist yet
5. **Archive confusion:** Move conflicting docs to `.archive/docs/`

## Archived Docs

See `.archive/docs/` for exploration docs that became conflicting/confusing. Not authoritative.
