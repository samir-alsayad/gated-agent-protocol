# Domain: Strategy

The Strategy Domain is dedicated to the **Persistent Alignment of Objectives**. It governs the high-level roadmap, resource allocation, and goal-setting processes within the library.

## 🎯 The Mission
To prevent "Strategic Drift" by ensuring all long-term goals are quantifiable, traceable, and bounded by operational risk.

## 🛠️ Work Types

### 1. [Strategic Planning](planning/)
High-level objective formulation and roadmapping.
- **Protocol**: [Strategic-Flow](planning/protocol.md)
- **Primary Constraint**: EARS-style OKR precision and resource bounds.

## 📜 Standard of Rigor
All strategic work MUST be ratified through **Operational Guardrails** and **Traceable Milestones**.
