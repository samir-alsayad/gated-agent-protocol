# Starter: Strategic Roadmap (Strategic-Flow)

This starter provides the document chain for defining and executing high-level strategy.

## Tier 1: Objectives (`objectives.md`)
*Define strategic intent using EARS-style OKRs.*

- **OBJ-1**: UNLESS [competitor action] occurs, THE [project] SHALL reach 10,000 active users by Q3.
- **OBJ-2**: IF [resource allocation] is approved, THE [expansion] SHALL launch in the European market.

## Tier 2: Operational Guardrails (`guardrails.md`)
*Define properties that bound strategic risk.*

- **GRD-1**: For any capital expenditure over $100k, the projected internal rate of return (IRR) shall exceed 20%.
- **GRD-2**: The Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) shall never exceed $50 per user for the duration of this project.

## Tier 3: Tactical Milestones (`milestones.md`)
*Atomic steps traced to objectives and guardrails.*
