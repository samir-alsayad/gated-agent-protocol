# Domain: Software

The Software Domain governs the **Deterministic Construction** of high-integrity systems. Code is not the primary artifact—it's the byproduct of a rigorously verified chain of intent.

## 🎯 Mission
Transform software engineering from "guess-and-test" into **Formalized Intent Execution**. Eliminate the gap between what humans want and what agents build.

## 🛠️ Work Types

### 1. [Development](development/) (4 Gates)
Creation of new systems or features from first principles.
- **Protocol**: [Specs-First Engineering](development/protocol.md)
- **Gates**: `intent.md` → `spec.md` → `plan.md` → `walkthrough.md`
- **Guard**: Determinism

### 2. [Maintenance](maintenance/) (2 Gates)
High-velocity patching, refactoring, and bug fixes.
- **Protocol**: [Patch-Flow](maintenance/protocol.md)
- **Gates**: `diagnosis.md` → `walkthrough.md`
- **Guard**: Reliability

## 📜 Standard of Rigor
All work MUST follow the **Manifested Gates** architecture, ensuring every artifact is traceable and every property is verified.
