# Domain: Meta

The Meta Domain is the **Governance Layer** of GAP. It defines the rules by which the framework itself operates, evolves, and scales.

## 🎯 Mission
Ensure the **Internal Integrity** of GAP. The Meta domain governs the protocols that govern other domains, creating a self-consistent ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Work Types

### 1. [Governance](governance/) (3 Gates)
The definition and enforcement of library-wide standards.
- **Protocol**: [Meta-Governance](governance/protocol.md)
- **Constraint**: Structural Auditability.

### 2. [Policy](policy/) (4 Gates)
High-stakes legislative changes requiring consensus.
- **Protocol**: [Legislative-Flow](policy/protocol.md)
- **Constraint**: Democratic Rigor with Risk Audit.

## 📜 Standard of Rigor
Governance changes are treated with the same engineering rigor as software development, requiring formal requirements and audit-based verification.
