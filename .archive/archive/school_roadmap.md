## 🚧 M05: Sentry Jail (Security)
*Status: To Be Designed*
The "Identity Firewall" is not enough. We need a "Process Jail" to safely run agent-generated code.
- **Task 5.1: The Chroot Pattern**: Creating the isolation folder (`/tmp/jail`).
- **Task 5.2: The Warden**: Writing the python wrapper (`warden.py`) that strictly limits subprocess calls.

- **Gate 5.4**: The Jailbreak Test (Foundry Assembly).

## 🚧 M06: Council Ignition (Intelligence)
*Status: To Be Designed*
Bootstrapping the specialized agents using the local stack.
- **Task 6.1: The Roll Call**: Defining the GAP Manifests for Librarian, Tutor, Critic.
- **Task 6.2: The Knowledge Injection**: Loading the `school-of-first-principles` curriculum into the Librarian's memory.
- **Task 6.3: The GAP Connector**: Connecting Letta agents to the GAP "Enforcer" tool.
- **Gate 6.4**: The First Council (Foundry Assembly).

## 🏁 M07: The Handover (Victory)
*Status: To Be Designed*
The final verification that the User is Sovereign.
- **Task 7.1**: The Disconnect (Unplug Ethernet).
