# Archived Documentation

These docs were created during exploration but became conflicting/confusing.

**They are NOT authoritative.**

Kept for reference only. The single source of truth is `/REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## What's Here

- `VISION.md` - Early exploration of strategic options
- `DECISION.md` - Decision matrix (before School use case was clear)
- `USE_CASE_SCHOOL.md` - Detailed School description (mixed real + aspirational)
- `REALITY_CHECK.md` - Analysis of what's real vs hallucinated

## Why Archived

- Too many conflicting "authoritative" docs
- Mix of real features and aspirational ideas
- AI wrote confidently about things that don't exist yet
- Created documentation debt spiral

## What to Use Instead

- `/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Single source of truth for requirements
- `/AUDIT_REPORT.md` - What's broken in the code
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md` - How the system works
- `/docs/refactor/` - Refactoring plan (intent, spec, plan)
