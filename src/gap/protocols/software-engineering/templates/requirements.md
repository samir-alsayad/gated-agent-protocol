*   **R-03**: **WHILE** [State], **THE** system **SHALL** [Response].
*   **R-04**: **THE** system **SHALL** [Response].

**The Golden Thread (Trinity)**:
These Requirements are the **immutable truth**. Every Design Property must validate at least one of these, and every Task must implement  at least one Property.
