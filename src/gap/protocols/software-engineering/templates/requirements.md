# Intent: {{ project_name }}

## 1. Context
{{ context_description }}

**Current State:** {{ current_state }}  
**Desired State:** {{ desired_state }}

## 2. Goals
Define what success looks like. Each goal should be measurable and traceable.

*   **G-01**: {{ goal_1 }}
*   **G-02**: {{ goal_2 }}
*   **G-03**: {{ goal_3 }}

## 3. Constraints
Define behavioral bounds using EARS syntax (WHEN...SHALL or IF...THEN...SHALL).

*   **C-01**: WHEN {{ trigger_condition }}, THE system SHALL {{ required_behavior }}.
*   **C-02**: IF {{ precondition }}, THEN THE system SHALL {{ required_response }}.
*   **C-03**: THE system SHALL NOT {{ forbidden_behavior }}.

## 4. Success Criteria
How will we know when this is complete?

*   [ ] {{ criterion_1 }}
*   [ ] {{ criterion_2 }}
