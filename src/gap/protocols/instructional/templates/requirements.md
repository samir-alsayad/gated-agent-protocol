# Learning Intent (Requirements): {{ project_name }}

## 1. The Why (Sovereign Intension)
{{ learning_intent_description }}

**Core Goal**: {{ primary_goal }}

## 2. Knowledge Requirements (The Source)
Define the measurable learning outcomes using **EARS** (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).

### [Conceptual Understanding]
*   **R-01**: **THE** student **SHALL** be able to explain {{ concept_1 }} from first principles.
*   **R-02**: **THE** student **SHALL** reconstruct the logic of {{ concept_2 }} without using external abstractions.

### [Operational Proof]
*   **R-03**: **WHEN** challenged with {{ lab_scenario }}, **THE** student **SHALL** demonstrate mastery by building {{ artifact_name }}.
*   **R-04**: **THE** student **SHALL** submit a reflection proving the "Why" behind their implementation.

**The Compliance Chain**:
These Knowledge Requirements are the **primary source**. Every Lesson (Design) and every Exercise (Task) must trace back to these goals.
