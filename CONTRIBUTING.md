# Contributing to GAP (Gated Agent Protocol)

Thank you for contributing to **GAP (Gated Agent Protocol)**. This project is dedicated to engineering rigor and the **Deterministic Execution of Human Intent**.

## 📜 The Golden Rule

Every contribution MUST be governed by a **Ratified Protocol**. If you are creating a new work-type, you must first define its protocol according to the **[GAP Specification](docs/standards/gap-specification.md)**.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### 1. Identify your Domain
Select the appropriate domain in the **[`/domains/`](domains/)** directory. If your domain doesn't exist, propose a new one to the Meta domain.

### 2. Follow the Protocol
Every domain has a `protocol.md` defining its "Operational Gates" and "Semantic Pillars". You MUST follow this protocol for your contribution.

### 3. Configure your Agent
Consult the **[Agent Steering Standard](docs/standards/agent-steering.md)** to ensure your AI collaborators are aligned with our rigor standards.

### 4. Prove Determinism
Every project must conclude with evidence proving that all domain **Invariants** have been satisfied.

*Rigor is the bridge between prompt and proof.*
