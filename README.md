# Gated Agent Protocol (GAP)

**Agents propose. Supervisors approve. The Ledger remembers.**

GAP is a **Protocol Engine** that enforces **Structure**, **Security**, and **Traceability** in agentic workflows. It prevents agents from deviating from requirements by strictly enforcing a "Workflow Compliance Layer".

---

## Alignment Phase and Execution Phase 

GAP splits the lifecycle of an agent's work into two distinct, **gated** classes. This ensures that the supervisor remains the final authority at every critical junction.

### 1. The Alignment Phase (Blueprint Logic)
Before a single line of code is written, the supervisor must approve a configurable set of artifacts the agent shall propose.
*   **Artifacts**: 
We use `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` for most types of work and domain, but these can be extended or omitted at will.
*   **The Gate**: **Mandatory Supervisor Approval**. The protocol prevents the agent from entering the Execution phase until the Supervisor has audited and signed off on the blueprint.
*   **Result**: A deterministic Contract that the agent is bound to follow during Execution.

### 2. The Execution/Implementation Phase (Throughput Logic)
Once the alignment is locked, the agent moves to implementation/execution:
*   **Artifacts**: Source code, reports, data, writing.
*   **Execution/Implementation**: Running tests, making tool calls, running benchmarks, etc.
*   **The Gate**: **Deterministic Checkpoints**. Based on the approved policy (`explicit`, `every`, or `batch`), the harness automatically pauses the agent for review.
*   **Result**: High-speed execution without loss of control.

### ⛓️ Workflow Compliance
GAP enforces a strict **Chain of Custody** from intent to implementation:

```
[ ALIGNMENT PHASE ]                 [ EXECUTION PHASE ]
Requirements → Design → Tasks  ==>  Implementation / Execution
      ↓          ↓       ↓                  ↓
   (gate)     (gate)   (gate)           (checkpoints)
```

### 3. Interaction Classification (Separation of Concerns)

GAP enforces a critical distinction between what the **Protocol** controls and what the **Agent** generates:

| Interaction Type | Owner | Mechanism | Examples |
|------------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Programmatic** | Protocol | **Deterministic Form** | Domain selection, policy forms, gate approvals |
| **Generative**   | Agent    | **Probabilistic Stream** | Requirements, design, tasks, code |

**The Philosophy of Determinism:**
We believe that **Authority must be Deterministic**. 
- An agent should not "hallucinate" its own security policy.
- A gate should not be "suggested" by an LLM.
- Critical boundaries (ACLs, Tool Permissions) are defined via rigid, unchangeable forms that the agent cannot influence.

This ensures that while the **work** is creative (AI), the **boundaries** are absolute (Code).

## 🌍 4. Example Domains

GAP is domain-agnostic. It enforces the same integrity whether you are building a CPU or writing a poem.

| Domain | Protocol | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🏗️ School** | `instructional` | Scribes first-principles curricula. |
| **💻 Software** | `software-dev` | High-integrity, ACL-gated coding. |
| **🔬 Science** | `benchmarking` | Verifiable experimental methodology. |
| **📖 Authoring** | `creative-writing` | Traceable narrative architecture. |

## 🛡️ 5. Core Engine Features

### 1. The Traceability Auditor
Run `gap check traceability` to verify the **Trinity of Intent**. The engine automatically detects "Orphaned Intent"—any task or design decision that cannot prove its pedigree back to a validated requirement.

### 2. Path-Locked Security (ACL)
Agents are confined to whitelisted directories defined in the approved `tasks.md`. No "leaking" into system files or unauthorized project areas.

### 3. Verification State Machine
A rigid graph of checkpoints (LOCKED -> PENDING -> APPROVED). Authority is never assumed; it is granted via explicit user gates.

### 4. Configurable Execution Gates
Each Session and Project defines its own specific execution gates, where the supervisor must approve the agent's work to allow it to proceed. With GAP, you set the checkpoints *before* you send the agent off.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- No external services required (Standard YAML/File-based Ledger)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# Stable release
pip install git+https://github.com/samir-alsayad/gated-agent-protocol.git@v1.0.0

# Or latest main branch
pip install git+https://github.com/samir-alsayad/gated-agent-protocol.git
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
gap --help
```

### Example Workflow

Create a `manifest.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: project
name: my-project
version: 1.0.0
description: "My first GAP project"

extends:
  - protocol: software-engineering

flow:
  - step: requirements
    artifact: docs/requirements.md
    gate: true  # Requires approval
    
  - step: design
    artifact: docs/design.md
    gate: true
    needs: [requirements]
    
  - step: implementation
    artifact: src/
    gate: false  # Autonomous
    needs: [design]
```

Then run:

```bash
# Check current state
gap check status manifest.yaml

# Create a proposal for requirements
gap scribe create requirements --manifest manifest.yaml

# Review and approve
gap gate list --manifest manifest.yaml
gap gate approve requirements --manifest manifest.yaml
```

**Output:**
```text
🟢 requirements: UNLOCKED
🔒 design: LOCKED (waiting for: requirements)
🔒 implementation: LOCKED (waiting for: design)
```

## 🏗️ 7. Reference Implementation

GAP provides a reference implementation to demonstrate the protocol in action.

### The Gated TUI (`gated_agent_tui`)
A stable, text-based interface for managing the Alignment phase. It allows you to:
- Scribe requirements and design.
- Audit the Trinity of Intent.
- Manage state transitions (LOCKED -> APPROVED).

### The GPTme Driver (`gap-gptme`)
> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental / Early Alpha**
> The native `gptme` driver is currently under development. While it demonstrates the power of autonomous execution with deterministic gates, it may encounter edge cases in tool handling and state persistence.

The GPTme driver is designed for **High-Throughput Execution**. Once Alignment is locked in the TUI, the GPTme driver takes over to implement the code, bound by the approved policies.
